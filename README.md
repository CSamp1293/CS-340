## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

One of the most effective methods to create software that is maintainable and readable is to utilize modular development. My initial CRUD method only included readability and creatability. However, moving to project two, updatability, and destroyability were added to the mix without the need to update the existing read and create methods of CRUD. This is an example of how modular development can be beneficial for bigger projects such as the dashboard project. 

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

To appraoch problems in computer science, I typically turn to my critical thinking ability and utilize it in such a way to breakdown a problem in smaller pieces to allow for much easier solving. In addition to critical thinking, utilizing test cases with pass/fail metrics is crucial in helping to solve challenges in a project. But above all, I always document what I did with a when and why mentality whether it be through comment in the code or on a personal word document with my own updtes and additions. 

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

A computer scientist is someone who creates solutions for coomputer problems, whether it be software or hardware issues. Computer scientists are crucial in helping businesses create and maintain databases, websites, etc. With my work on this project, I was able to make querying easier and manageable based on a database that presents itself as a dashboard for easy searching, creating, updating, and destroying as a computer scientist.
